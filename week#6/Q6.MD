# Question for week 6

## Question
Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.

From each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e. wrap-around is not allowed).

## Example 1:
```
nums = [
  [9,9,4],
  [6,6,8],
  [2,1,1]
]
```
Return 4

The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].

# Example 2:
```
nums = [
  [3,4,5],
  [3,2,6],
  [2,2,1]
]
```
Return 4

The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.

## C++
```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestIncreasingPath(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        
    }
};
```

## Python
```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestIncreasingPath(self, matrix):
        """
        :type matrix: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        
```
